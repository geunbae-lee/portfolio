                            <p class="project-desc">Georgia Tech research group of four engineers with different backgrounds came together to design a responsive letter board for autistic children. Our team investigated the current use-case of letterboards. We evaluated stakeholders, determined their needs, then designed, laser cut and programmed a brand new working board with wifi capability.</p>
                            <h3 class="overview_subtitle">My Role</h3>
                            <p class="project-desc">As a team, we all participated in the initial research phase. Then, I focused on creating wireframes with Balsamiq Mockups so that I could design the UI of the web interface. After I designed it, I developed the web view with HTML/CSS and JS. After that, I focused on retrieving data from the back-end which initially would be passed on by the responsive letterboard.</p>

                    <p class="project-desc">The Rapid Prompting Method (RPM) is a method to help children with Autism Spectrum Disorder who cannot write the ability to communicate their thoughts. Initially, Rapid Prompting Method, was developed by Soma Mukhopadhyay, an Indian mother who wanted to teach her non-verbal son, Tito, who has austim, to express himself and expand his mind. By using this method, Soma was able to teach Tito how to read, write and type. The main objective of RPM is help “verbal and written expression.”<br><br>

                        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                             <p class="project-desc">RPM is a method that through practice, patience and consistency can be used by parents and professionals with their students. Incorporating a daily discipline of using the method for academic teaching and to introduce the concepts into the student's daily life is best. The process of RPM is quite simple: a teacher gives a short lesson on a topic, asks a question and then elicits a response using verbal, auditory, or visual prompts. The child will answer based on the teacher’s question by spelling out the letters written on the letterboard. RPM, by using the letterboard has been proven to have positive effect on children with Autism. Eventually, students learn to provide their responses by either spelling, handwriting and/or speaking, leading towards open-ended communication.</p>

                    <p class="project-desc">We visited local elementary schools and houses to meet Autistic children and their parents, caregivers or clinicians. During our visits, we attended and viewed the Rapid Prompting Method sessions done with the Autistic children using the currently existing letterboards. From doing so, we were able to get various insights by understanding how the clinicians or the caregiver communicate with the Autistic children and also what the general flow (process) would be like. Moreover, by conducting several unstructured interviews along the way, we discovered a few things:<br><br>
                    • Since there is no technology involved (only physical letterboards), it's tough to collect data of how the child is doing<br>
                    • No data means, the clinicians or the caregivers have limitations to conduct much more productive sessions or to customize sessions</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="project_subtitle" id="Design_engineering">Design and Engineering</h3>
                    <p class="project-desc">The main objective of our project was to integrate an existing piece of hardware with a sleek interface for the facilitators, teachers and parents of autistic children. A well designed user interface and sophisticated hardware artefact needed to communicate in order to work in unison. This requires a quick and efficient backend that is reliable and easy to configure.<br><br>
                    For the purpose of our work we decided to develop our backend server on Flask. This is a simple Python based framework that can be easily hosted and is rather lightweight compared to other such frameworks in the open source world. A Python based framework not only makes it easy for future collaborators to tinker with this, as Python is a fairly popular language, it also provides the option to include various versatile features from existing libraries for future implementations.
                    This backend server is based on the REST API architecture and allows both GET and POST requests on specific handles. These requests are used by the interface and the responsive letterboard respectively to communicate with the server. In order to support quick real-time transactions between what a child touches on the board and what is displayed - the backend maintains a simple tuple based data structure that keeps a record of &lt;timestamp, character&gt;.<br><br>
                    <img src="img/letterboard/design_engineering.jpg" alt="Design and Engineering">
                    The frontend JS uses regular interval AJAX query to continuously “ping” the backend with GET requests and receive the &lt;timestamp, character&gt;, that is accordingly updated on the user-facing interface. The JS is also robust enough to check the incoming characters from the letterboard with the characters that should be spelt based on the word the facilitator inputs. This happens with the help of using two different pointers on two different arrays - one for the word entered by the teacher and one for the incoming characters from the letterboard. This dual cursor correction allows us to measure the difference between selected and actual character, which in turn helps us calculate the accuracy of the child’s response in real time.<br><br>

                    By design this server can be easily hosted locally on the personal interface by the users. However, this is also light enough to push onto a hosting app and use a simple cloud data structure like SQLite.

                    <p class="project-desc">Our responsive letterboard has three major components:<br><br>
                    • MPR121 Capacitive Touch Sensor Breakout<br>
                    • Feather HUZZAH ESP 8266 Wi Fi module with built-in battery charging and JST jack<br>
                    • Lithium Polymer Battery <br><br>

                    The capacitive touch sensor used here has twelve channel which means it can handle twelve individual touch pads. Since there are twenty-six letters in our board, we have considered specific grid architecture that enables us using just eleven channels of the sensor. Such implementation is explained in next section and shown in figure . Adding Wi-Fi module into circuit allows sending collected data from capacitive touch sensor, to technician’s/ trainer’s laptop in a wireless mode. More importantly, since an ESP8622 Wi-Fi microcontroller is embedded in Feather HUZZAH, the microcontroller can be programmed using Arduino IDE. To make the board easily portable, a 3.7 V Lithium polymer battery is used to manage power.  </p>

                    <p class="project-desc">Our responsive letterboard has three major components:<br><br>
                    • Create a Grid of Conductors<br>
                    • Design Printed Circuit Board (PCB) in Eagle (Circuit Design Software)<br>
                    • Fabricate PCB Board <br><br>

                    The hardware part of this interactive letterboard consists four specific layers. First layer which user interact with it as a physical interface, appears with alphabets. second substrate is a grid of aluminum foils attached to the intersection of conductive wires in rows and columns. Third substrate is combination of five rows and 6 columns. There is an isolator between conductive wires in rows and conductive wires in columns. However, there are holes on paper which is an isolator sheet here. By having these holes, sensing the touch is possible since, touching the letter provide a tuple of two touch channels in Capacitive touch sensor. Adding the isolator in between is required since we need to avoid interference in two channels’ capacitance.</p>

However more user testing is required and discussions with stakeholders to determine if our product is viable for market.<br><br>
